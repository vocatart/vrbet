# Korean VrBet

Written Korean is no longer phonetic due to how the language has evolved.  
However, the Korean alphabet, hangul, is still able to be used as a true phonetic script.  
For example the word for the Korean language is written as "한국어", but in phonetic hangul it is transcribed as /한구거/  
Due to the phonetic nature of hangul, there is a direct equivalence with the transcription of korean phonemes.

- Historically Korean has had phonemic vowel length. However this feature has been lost in standard Seoul dialect with many words that historically
  were pronounced with long vowels no longer being distinguished from their short vowel counterparts.
  Some minimal pairs of more common words may still exist in standard Korean.
  Examples:
  /일/ "one" vs. /일ː/ "work"
  /눈/ "eye" vs. /눈ː/ "snow"  
  /말/ "horse" vs. /말ː/ "speech"  
- The majority of younger Koreans have merged /ɛ/ and /e/ into a single mid-front vowel [e̞]  
  This also applies to the pronunciation of these vowels within the glide diphthongs.  
  Distinguishment of the two vowels is maintained by some older speakers and some registers of formal speech.  
- The diphthong /je/ is commonly merged with /e/ when occuring after most onset consonants.  
  Some speakers may specifically distinguish "녜" /nje/ and "례" /lje/ from "네" /ne/ and "레" /le/.  
  The sequence "셰" /sje/ is sometimes distinguished for the sake of transcribing loanwords containing [ʃe] such as in "셰이크" ("shake")  
  This sound is also alternatively transcribed with the grapheme "쉐" representing the non-standard sequence /sɥe/ as in "쉐이크" ("shake")   
  Despite the prevalent merging of /ɛ/ and /e/, the diphthong /jɛ/ does not undergo degliding when preceded by an onset consonant.  
  This results in /jɛ/ and /je/ being still distinguished in this context. (Example: "걔" /kjɛ/ [kje̞] vs. "계" /kje/ [ke̞])  
- The vowel /ø/ often undergoes vowel breaking for most speakers, merging it with /we/.  
  This creates a common merging of the three phonemes /wɛ/, /we/, and /ø/ all into [we̞]  
- The diphthong /ɥi/ was historically a monophthong /y/ in Early Modern Korean.  
  Similar to /ø/, /y/ underwent vowel breaking; which resulted in the standard diphthong pronunciation in contemporary Korean.  
  However it is common for the korean diphthongs to be unglided or monophthongized when in interconsonant position in informal speech,  
  resulting in [ø] and [y] still occurring non-phonemically for many speakers.  
- The diphthong /ɰi/ has merged with /i/ in the vast majority of cases.  
  /ɰi/ is distinguished specifically when occuring word-initially, and only when not preceded by an onset consonant.  
  This partial merging is so prevalent to the extent that pronouncing the glide /ɰ/ is considered nonstandard in any other position.  
  The possessive particle "의", although written with the digraph for /ɰi/, is instead pronounced /e/ in standard Korean.  
  These processes result in the phrase "의의의" ("of significance") being phonemically realized as /ɰi.i.e/ rather than /ɰi.ɰi.ɰi/

|  ɥe |  ywe   |   ㆋ   |
|  jø |  yoe   |   ㆉ   |

- /ɒ/ is a vowel from Middle Korean that has merged with /a/ in all dialects of mainland Korea. Its use still persists in Jeju.
- /ɥʌ/ occurs as a reduction of the sequence /ɥi.ʌ/ such as in "사귀어", "쉬어", "휘어"  
  and is commonly represented with the grapheme "ㅕ" such as "사겨", "셔", "혀"
- /ɥe/ is used in the sequence /sɥe/ written as "쉐" to transcribe /ʃe, ʃɛ, ʃæ/ in English loanwords.
  Using "섀" /sjɛ/ for English /ʃæ/ and "셰" /sje/ for English /ʃe/ and /ʃɛ/ is now considered standard,  
  however the use of /sɥe/ is still very prevalent, particularly in the transcription of proper nouns.
  Examples: 쉐보레 (Chevrolet), 쉐이크쉑 (Shake Shack)
- /jø/ was once used to transcribe similar sounds in Germanic languages until as recently as the 1980's.
  However with newer standards for the transcription of loanwords it has been replaced by the use of /ø/ and /je/ instead.
  ᄉᆈᆫ베르크 "Schönberg", ᄋᆈᆫᄉᆈ핑 "Jönköping", which has since become 쇤베르크 "Schönberg", 옌셰핑 "Jönköping"

- The unaspirated consonants /p, t, k, ts/ are frequently voiced when preceded by a sonorant and followed by a vowel.
- The realization of /l/ varies greatly by context.
  In intervocal position it is realized as a flap.
  In coda position it is realized as a lateral approximant homorganic to the onset following it.
  In the case that coda /l/ is followed by an onset /l/ or pause, it is commonly retroflex,
  unless the adjacent vowels are /i, j, ɥ/ in which /l/ becomes alveolo-palatal. 
- Non-geminating clusters only occur in coda position and are only fully pronounced when intervocalic.
  When followed by an onset consonant or pause, clusters are neutralized and merged with coda /p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l/ depending on context.
- /ŋ/ only occurs in coda position. The grapheme "ㅇ" represents a null initial when written as an onset.
- The alveolar consonants /l, n, t, ts, s, tʰ, tsʰ/ are typically realized as alveolo-palatal before /i, j, ɥ/
- The patalization of the affricates /ts/ and /tsʰ/ vary slightly more between speakers.
  While some may only palatalize before /i, j, ɥ/ similar to other alveolars,  
  in standard Seoul dialect the affricates are realized alveolo-palatal in all cases.
  This causes a merging of the sequences of these onsets before /a, ɛ, ʌ, e, o, u/ with their counterparts before /ja, jɛ, jʌ, je, jo, ju/
  Some speakers may not palatalize /s/, /ts/, or /tsʰ/ at all.
